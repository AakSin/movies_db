I have a school project wherein I need to create a movie ticket booking system. I am not very familiar with relational/sql databases. I can define the schema in a noSQL/json format. Can anyone tell me how I will be able to implement this schema in sql.
{movies:[
    {
    index=1
    name:"ABC",
    director:"XYZ",
    language:"English",
    genre:"Thriller",
    shows:[
        {index="1",
        timing:"4:15 PM",
        seats_left=50},
        {index="2",
        timing:"7:15 PM",
        seats_left=30}
    ]
    },
    {
    index=2
    name:"DEF",
    director:"LMN",
    language:"English",
    genre:"Action",
    shows:[
        {index="1",
        timing:"4:15 PM",
        seats_left=50},
        {index="2",
        timing:"7:15 PM",
        seats_left=30}
    ]
    }
]
